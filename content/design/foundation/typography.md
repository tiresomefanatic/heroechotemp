The VDA UI is an engaging and distinctive way to demonstrate the dynamic nature of our brand identity. The intentional slant captures attention, reinforcing the establishment of our branding across various touchpoints.

The angle of the slant correlates with the weight of the typeface. For example, PP Neue Montreal Bold carries a sense of readiness, stability, and grounding. Alternatively, PP Neue Montreal Thin conveys a feeling of movement, dynamism, and potential energy.

These angles are not strict rules but rather examples of how font weight can influence the tilt angle.
